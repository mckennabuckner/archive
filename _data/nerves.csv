coll001,leftshoulder.jpg,,,Musculocutaneous nerve,McKenna Buckner,1747,"This is the left shoulder of the subject of this patient. To the far left you can see the bone wrapping around the outside of the shoulder. Under that, we start to see the tissue under the bone which it is being protected by. Next, there are arteries running along the neck headed towards the brain. These are winded together in an intricate way. Then on the inside we have what looks to be the rib cage of the human cut open showing the chest cavity opened up. Scarpa was particularly interested in this illustration as he was fascinated with the two different plates of the glossopharyngeal nerves. This work of art alone was sculpted out of twenty years of research of the cardiac nerves. The impeccable detail in these five life-like photos is why Antonio Scarpaâ€™s work is considered unbelievably magnificent.","arteries, muscles, left side","Pavia, Italy",45.183334,9.15,"Rey, Oversize Plus, WL, 17, SCA76t, 1794"
coll002,heart.jpg,,,Broken Heart,McKenna Buckner,1747,"Next, we have a picture primarily focused on the heart. The heart has two big arteries attached to it coming from the brain and right side of the body. The heart looks divided into two sections, the bigger one on the right side as the picture shows, and the smaller one on the left. This is divided by arteries zigzagging through the middle. The heart also has arteries spread out all across the heart seeing the pop out an unusual amount. There are also veins running all along the artery going to the neck and the right side of the body. One can also see to the right side of the picture the rib cage cut open to allow sight to what is inside. There are a crazy amount of veins running through the whole center of this picture going to all different parts of the body.","liver, heart, lungs, spleen","Pavia, Italy",45.183334,9.15,"Rey, Oversize Plus, WL, 17, SCA76t, 1794"
coll003,rightshoulder.jpg,,,Intercostal nerves,Luke Touliatos,1747,This is the right shoulder of the subject of this patient. To the far left you can see the bone wrapping around the outside of the shoulder. Under that we start to see the tissue under the bone which it is being protected by. Next there are arteries running along the neck headed towards the brain. These are winded together in an intricate way. Then on the inside we have what looks to be the rib cage of the human cut open showing the chest cavity opened up. Here we have the heart centered in this photo. We have one main artery that we can see here running from the heart to the brain. There is also an organ popping out from behind the heart that we can partially see. To the far right we have the outside visual of the shoulder. Hidden behind the heart by some arteries and veins wew have what looks like another tube running to the head area. On the far right side we can also see the rib cage so the viewer can see into the chest cavity. There are also veins popping on the outside of the heart in a very defined way. Also in two spots in the middle of the picture there looks to be some type of string pulling the chest skin away from the center so that we can see what is inside.,"lymph nodes, lungs, bone marrow, right shoulder","Pavia, Italy",45.183334,9.15,"Rey, Oversize Plus, WL, 17, SCA76t, 1794"

coll005,face.jpg,,,Distressed emotions,McKenna Buckner,1747,The bottom portion of the face has a lot of veins running through it up into the brain. These veins or arteries are in many different shapes and sizes. Some look like these little tubes and others are all tiny and scrunched together. On the bottom right of the picture there is what looks to be a string pulling the skin back from the neck so that we can see what is inside. On the right side of the man's face we see his ear and veins that are running into his ears. There looks to be two layers of skin peeled on one another right under the ear. In the direct center of the photo there is a hole looking to lead to the center of the brain. To the direct right there is a circular patch of tissue connecting to the chiun area. Coming off the front of the chin there looks to be a grab of skin flopping off where it was cut to see inside.,"brain, larynx, pharynx, face","Pavia, Italy",45.183334,9.15,"Rey, Oversize Plus, WL, 17, SCA76t, 1794"
